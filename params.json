Quarks can include Instr/ folders to share with others.\r\n* __InstrBrowser__ —\r\n\tperuse and search your installed Instr\r\n\r\n* __Patch__ — an Instr player\r\n* __Player__ — class framework for objects that play. manages loading of resources, includes support for sound file recording and saving object state to file.\r\n\r\n* __extended Spec system__ — extended datatypes specifications\r\n\r\n* __OSCSched__ — schedule OSC bundles to be sent just prior to event time. revoke scheduled bundles, relocate in time, stop, change tempo\r\n* __BeatSched__ — full featured function scheduling with same features as OSCSched\r\n\r\n* __Tempo__ - tempo calculations and centralized control\r\n* __TempoBus__ - maintains a control rate bus on scsynth\r\n\r\n* __MultiChanRecorder__ — utility for recording multiple Busses to disk\r\n\r\n* __Editors__\r\n\t* NumberEditor\r\n\t* EnvEditor\r\n\t* DictionaryEditor\r\n\r\n\r\n* __SFP__ — SoundFilePlayer\r\n\r\n* __Sample__ — easy to load to server, beat matching and slicing tools\r\n\r\n* __StreamKrDur__ — play Pseq and friends at \\control rate on a Bus\r\n* __Stream2Trig__ - play Pseq and friends as rhythmic \\trigs on a Bus\r\n\r\n* __InstrSpawner__ — similar to Pbind for Instr\r\n* __InstrGateSpawner__ — similar to Pbind for Instr\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
