DESCRIPTION::  pending deprecation.



CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: initClass

Adds a GUI skin named \crucial.

This skin is slightly cleaner and more basic than the default.
Put GUI.setSkin(\crucial) in your startup if you wish to use it.



METHOD:: initSpecs


This defines a bunch of Specs which I find are useful.  Nothing depends on these.
